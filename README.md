Odin Project Recipes


Hi!
if you read this then you have a curiosity about my code, and I 
truly appreciate it.

So I'm currently a student of The Odin Project, basically it is
a source of free course that lead you to learn programming, it's
been so good so far. I really like it.

Right now I'm writing code for my next assignment, I maybe just 
started but I learned many things such as basic of Linux and its
command, how to setup Github, and HTML code & CSS (next one)

I'm just grateful that I found this website, I am glad that 
this community gave me strength and believe to learn programming
again (I've learned couple of things back in college).

Thankyou for reading and have a nice day, week, months, and years to come!
